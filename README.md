### WKL1086 - Wordle

This project is inspired by the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game. The goal of the game is to guess a five-letter word in six tries.

The idea of making the game inside the github profile is inspired by [rossjrw/rossjrw](https://github.com/rossjrw/rossjrw) and [DoubleGremlin181/DoubleGremlin181](https://github.com/DoubleGremlin181/DoubleGremlin181).
