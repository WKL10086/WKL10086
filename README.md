### WKL1086 - Wkldle

The game idea is inspired by the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game. The goal of the game is to guess a five-letter word in six tries.

The idea of making the game inside the github profile is inspired by [rossjrw/rossjrw](https://github.com/rossjrw/rossjrw) and [DoubleGremlin181/DoubleGremlin181](https://github.com/DoubleGremlin181/DoubleGremlin181).

I think it's a cool idea to make a game inside the github profile after seeing their profile. It's also a chance for me to explore the github actions workflow. So I decided to make the a "Wordle" game which I used to play a lot in my free time.
